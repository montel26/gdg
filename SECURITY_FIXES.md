# Security Fixes and Improvements - GDG DevFest 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the critical security fixes and improvements made to the GDG DevFest application.

## ‚úÖ Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Client-Side Authentication Vulnerability (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Authentication was implemented purely on the client-side with hardcoded credentials.

**Fix**:
- Removed hardcoded credentials from `app/admin/login/page.tsx`
- Updated login to use server-side API (`/api/auth/login`)
- Updated admin page to use `/api/auth/check` for authentication verification
- Implemented proper server-side logout via `/api/auth/logout`

**Files Changed**:
- `app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Now uses API instead of localStorage
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Now validates auth via API

**Next Steps**:
- Create `.env.local` file with your admin credentials:
  ```
  ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username
  ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  ```

### 2. Database Initialization Improvements

**Problem**: Database was being automatically seeded with speakers, sessions, and reviews on every build.

**Fix**:
- Disabled automatic data seeding
- Database now only creates admin user on first initialization
- Manual data entry via admin panel is now the only method for adding content

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/db.ts` - Commented out seeding code, added early return after admin user creation

**Benefits**:
- Clean database for manual content entry
- No unwanted test data
- You have full control over event content

### 3. Next.js 15 Compatibility - Async Params

**Problem**: API routes were using synchronous params which is deprecated in Next.js 15.

**Fix**:
- Updated all API routes to properly await params
- Changed from `{ params }: { params: { id: string } }` to `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`

**Files Changed**:
- `app/api/speakers/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/sessions/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/reviews/[id]/route.ts`

### 4. Fixed Type Mismatch - Speaker Images

**Problem**: Session detail page was using `speaker.avatar` instead of `speaker.image`.

**Fix**:
- Changed property reference from `avatar` to `image`

**Files Changed**:
- `app/sessions/[id]/page.tsxsettlement`

### 5. Prevented Database Re-initialization During Build

**Problem**: Database was initializing multiple times during build causing race conditions.

**Fix**:
- Commented out automatic initialization on module import
- Database initialization must now be triggered manually or via `/api/init` endpoint

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/db.ts`

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (DO NOT commit this to git):

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-session-secret-here
```

### Password Requirements

Use a strong password for your admin account:
- At least 16 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Do not use common words or personal information

## üìã Manual Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Admin Account

First time setup (database will auto-create admin user):
1. Create `.env.local` with your credentials
2. Start the server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit `/admin/login`
4. Login with your credentials

### 2. Add Content

Once logged in:
1. Use the Admin Panel to add Speakers
2. Add Sessions and link them to speakers
3. Add Event details
4. Reviews are added by users automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- Default admin credentials (`admin`/`admin123`) are only used if no `.env.local` is present
- Server-side authentication is now enforced - client-side bypass is not possible
- Database is clean by default - you must add content manually

## üß™ Testing

After these fixes:
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ No linter errors
- ‚úÖ No more multiple database initializations during build
- ‚úÖ Authentication is server-side validated
- ‚úÖ API routes compatible with Next.js 15

## üìù Remaining Items (Optional)

1. Update Next.js to latest version to fix security vulnerabilities:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix --force
   ```

2. Consider adding middleware for route protection (optional but recommended)

3. Remove unused image files from project root if not needed

4. Add session timeout handling in the auth system

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues with these changes, please check:
1. That `.env.local` exists with correct credentials
2. That database file has correct permissions
3. Server logs for any error messages
